		If you aren't aware, I made <a href="https://github.com/micah-wehrle/wehrledev">this site</a>. It has been 100% my own work with Google being the only other contributor.
		<br><br><br>
		Why?
		<br>
		I've always enjoyed coding and working with computers, so a large part of my motivation for this project is that it has been a hobby I enjoy. However, my desire with this site is also to demonstrate my ability to be a creative force in whatever I set my mind to. 
		<br><br>
		Coming into this project, I only really had experience in Java and the niche "play" language Expression 2. I took a general computer class in high school where one of our projects was to make a website in Dream Weaver, but overall I was a complete beginner. 
		<br><br><br>
		How?
		<br>
		A friend of mine purchased an HP Stream to use for work, but didn't realize its limitations, and so gave it to me. Eventually I got the idea to use it to host a website, so I purchased some static IPs, bought the domain wehrle.dev, and got the server up and running.
		<br>
		I used Caddy Server to host, and GitHub to store my version history as well as allow me to work on the website from a different computer than the host.
